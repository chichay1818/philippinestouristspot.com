<p> Apao Rolling Hills is a serene location that provides visitors with a panoramic view of the surrounding hills and valleys. The hills are accessible through a challenging but rewarding trek that takes around two hours to complete. The trail leading to the hills is steep and rocky, but it is well worth the effort once you reach the top. </p><br>
<p> Such 360 degrees of pure majestic view of the wave-like hills with no large trees but plain brown and green grasses in the rainy seasons provides relaxing atmosphere for travelers who wanted to feel the cool and fresh air. </p><br>
<p> The sea of clouds can also be seen in the early morning. To reach Apao paradise hills, you have to travel an hour and half from the provincial capital of Bangued. The road is not fully concreted yet but any type of vehicles can pass. </p><br>
