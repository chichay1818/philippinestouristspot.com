<center><h1> The Banaue Rice Terraces  </h1></center>
<p> The Banaue Rice Terraces are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and are often referred to as the "Eighth Wonder of the World." Carved into the mountains over 2,000 years ago by the Ifugao people, these terraces showcase incredible agricultural engineering and offer stunning panoramic views.</p><br>
<p> The terraces soar to around 1500m above sea level and, since they are located in one of the most remote parts of the Philippines' main island of Luzon, it takes a bit of a trek to get there, a fact that seems to deter the usual cavalcade of coach-bound tourists.</p>
<p>The rice terraces here were declared in 2009 free from any genetically modified organisms. Farming in the area is carried out much the same way it was carried out hundreds of years ago. </p>
<p>The terraces can be visited anytime of the year but the best time for a visit is between February and March when the cleaning and planting time occurs and between June and July when the harvest occurs.</p><br>
