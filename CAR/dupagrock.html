<p> In Conner, Apayao, there is a remarkable rock formation called Dupag Rock Formation. It is a well-liked location for hikers and environment lovers and has enormous, attractive limestone rocks. </p>
<p> For those outside its borders, Apayao is still mostly unknown. Furthermore, it is frequently mistaken for still being a part of Kalinga, which, up until 1995, consisted of the province Kalinga-Apayao. </p>
<p> It is possible that Mareng Jessica Soho and her group traveled to the remote province of Apayao in 2018 to introduce this unique marvel. As we drew closer to the Mother Rock, or the apex of the rock structure, things took an intriguing turn. There are rock walls everywhere; certain parts needed careful climbing. </p>
