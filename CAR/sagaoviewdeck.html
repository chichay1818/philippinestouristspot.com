<p> Danglas is another exciting highland town in Abra , located at the boarder of Ilocos Norte and it's mother Province of Abra . The recenly constructed Abra-Ilocos Norte road viewed the beauty of Danglas . It's more accessible than ever . Ith's just an hour from Bangued â€“ capital of Abra . </p><br>
<p> The newest attraction that Abra which is open to the public , it is Nagaparan , Danglas . Where Abrenian called it as "Little Baguio of Abra" because of the pine trees and the cold temperature also with the strong wind which you will find very relaxing . But for me , it is cooler than Baguio because it's located in a higher altitude range . </p><br>
