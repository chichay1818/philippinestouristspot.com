<p> The Tangadan Tunnel is an engineering marvel located in Abra, a province in the northern region of the Philippines. This tunnel serves as a vital transportation link, connecting the municipalities of Tubo and Baay-Licuan. Its construction began in 1934 and was completed in 1936, providing a safer and more convenient travel option for locals and tourists alike. </p>
<p> Tangadan Tunnel is also known locally as "Usok" located in Brgy. Tangadan in the town of San Quintin. It has a length of 62.5 meters. If you try to notice the provincial seal, there is a horse symbolism and at the side of the tunnel, there is a row of horses too. Near the tunnel is a horse monument where Gabriela Silang is riding. </p>
<p> The construction of the tunnel started in 1934, an imperative need to divert the old road which was very steep and difficult to negotiate. More than fifty workers labored for two years, hammering, drilling and blasting their way through solid rocks. The resulting structure was a crude one. The walls were not reinforced so that loose rocks fell when rains came.
It was only in 1961 that restoration works started, a feat accomplished through the efforts of former congressman Lucas Paredes who worked for the appropriation of over P200,000.00 for the tunnel's reconstruction and improvement. </p>
