<center><h1> Tinongchol Burial Site </h1></center>
<p> Located in the town of Hingyon, the Tinongchol Burial Site is an ancient burial cave that provides a unique glimpse into Ifugao burial practices. The site features wooden coffins stacked within the cave, showcasing the cultural significance of ancestral veneration and traditional burial customs.</p><br>
<p> Here, century-old mummies were kept in huge jars or makeshift   coffins. The mummification practice by the ancestors made it possible for some cadavers to remain intact; some have their tattoos evident up to now.</p>
<p>It is almost as big as a regular three-storey building, houses centuries-old mummies. This came about through the labor of the people of the old times, who bored holes on the solid shoulders where they interred their dead. </p>
<p>Making the holes and spaces in the rock was not easy.  No iron tools were found inside when the tomb was discovered.  The Ibalois drenched the rock with a ginger solution that softened the stone and made digging easier.</p><br>
