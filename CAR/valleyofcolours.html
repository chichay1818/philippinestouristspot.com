<p> The Valley of Colors is composed of three villages transformed from drab sights to a tourist attraction. These include the Stone Hill, Sadjap, and Batiwtiw. Since the project started in January of last year, over 180 houses were painted in bright colors and thus created a giant mural. </p>
<p> The Valley of Colors is an artwork commissioned as part of a Government project for promotion of tourism. It is depicted in its lovely and colorful houses and buildings built in three similar localities on lush green mountains of Barangay Balili, in the outskirts of Baguio city in Phillipines.</p>
