<p> Art In Island is an innovative tourist attraction in Manila, Philippines, renowned for its interactive 3D art museum. Established in 2014, the museum offers a dynamic experience where visitors can engage with and become part of the artwork.

With over a hundred mural paintings covering walls and floors, the museum provides a canvas for visitors to unleash their creativity and imagination.

<p> The history of Art In Island traces back to the vision of a group of Korean artists and entrepreneurs who sought to bring interactive art experiences to the Philippines.

Through meticulous planning and collaboration with local artists, the museum gradually took shape, attracting attention for its unique approach to showcasing art.

<p> Since its inception, Art In Island has garnered widespread acclaim and become a popular destination for both locals and tourists.
