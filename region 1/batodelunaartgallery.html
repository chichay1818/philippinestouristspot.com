<center><h1> BATO DE LUNA ART GALLERY </h1></center>
<p>Bato de Luna is an art gallery that showcases the works of Mr. Bong Kim, a Korean stone sculptor. It exhibits different art using stones (Luna has a pebble-covered beach) and mural arts. It is located in Nalvo Norte, Luna, La Union. Prior to Bato de Luna, there was Bahay na Bato, then Kamay na Bato (Stone Hand). Bahay na Bato is the resthouse of Dr. Edison and Dra. Purita Chan Noble, constructed along the coast of Luna, La Union. It was decorated by Mr. Kim with carved stones, antique materials, and wood carvings. The couple opened their resthouse to the public in 2014 and we were able to visit it in 2016.</p>
<p>Majority of the art pieces are made of stones and created by Mr. Kim himself. Some of it were carved by his students as he shared his talent to the locals. Wood carvings, paintings, 3D wall decors, and other interesting pieces are also part of the gallery. </p>
