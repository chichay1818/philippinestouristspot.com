<center><h1> BAUANG BEACH  </h1></center>
<p> Bauang beach is accessible to any form of land transportation. Its calm waters, fine sand, and languidly swaying coconut trees along the shoreline from Baccuit Sur to Pagdalagan Sur make it perfect for jet skiing, scuba diving and swimming. </p><br>
<p> The version that is interesting though is the word "buang" which means "river split into two" before flowing into the sea. As it is, the Bauang river is split into two by a delta. In one part of the delta is a vast mangrove plantation that is being developed by the municipal government.</p>
