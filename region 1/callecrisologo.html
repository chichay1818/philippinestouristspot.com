<center><h1> Calle Crisologo </h1></center>
<p> Located in Vigan, Calle Crisologo is a cobblestone street lined with centuries-old Spanish colonial houses. Walking down this street feels like taking a step back in time, and it's a great way to get a sense of what life was like during the Spanish colonial period.</p><br>
<p> The street is part of Vigan's picturesque Heritage Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This consists of about 200 beautifully restored houses dating back to the 16th century. The buildings on Crisologo particularly display a blend of indigenous Filipino and colonial European construction. </p><br>
<p> It took 10 years for Vigan to be named a World Heritage Site since it was submitted for consideration in 1989. The town was initially rejected for inclusion reportedly because it could not compare with Spanish-Colonial cities such as Cartagena in Colombia and Trinidad in Cuba. </p><br>
