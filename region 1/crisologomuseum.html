<p> Crisologo Museum is best known for being the ancestral home of the late statesman Floro S. Crisologo, whom it was named after. However, he was unfortunately assassinated in the 1970s while inside the St. Paul's Cathedral. Despite the tragic event, his wife, Carmeling, and the rest of his family decided not to seek vengeance on his behalf.</p><br>
<p> Instead, they chose to honor his life and his achievements inside his home. Soon, the family opened the mansion up to the public, and it is now one of the most iconic museums in the Philippines. Upon entering the first floor, you can find Floro's study and library, which has been filled with news clippings about him and his family. Visitors can even enter the master's bedroom that contains some of his most prized possessions.</p><br>
<p> The museum's main exhibit is the bloodied clothes the late congressman was wearing when he was shot. Aside from the clothes, an old car is also preserved in the home. It was the same vehicle his wife was riding when someone tried to take her life. Fortunately, the bullet did not hit Carmeling, and she lived until the age of 94 before dying in 2018.</p><br>
