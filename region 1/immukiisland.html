<center><h1> IMMUKI ISLAND  </h1></center>
<p> IMMUKI is a word which was derived from a sea creature that can thrive only on the paringit (dead corals) â€“ these are the SEA SLUGS or BABAO. BABAO or BAO is a Pangasinense term which refers to the female genital or in Ilocano, UKI. Since then, the word IMMUKI has been associated with the island also because the shape of its main lagoon is like the shape of a female genital.</p><br>
<p> At present, the IMMUKI ISLAND is a stunning island, not anymore a mere paringit because of the mangroves (Bantigue/Nirad) on it. The crystal clear waters where you can see fish swimming is also an added attraction. IMMUKI ISLAND is located in Barangay Paraoir, Balaoan, La Union.</p><
