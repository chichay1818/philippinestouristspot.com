<p>Recognized for its historical and cultural charms, Vigan City has drawn flocks of travelers to Ilocos Sur over the years. Contributing to its overall appeal is the Pagburnayan Jar Factory. It is one of the few remaining factories that continue the traditional way of making burnay, or unglazed earthen jars, dating back to colonial times. The art of making jars originally came from Chinese traders who eventually settled in Vigan. </p><br>
<p>To spread the appreciation of making these clay jars, the factory lets travelers try their hand in molding their own creations during Vigan tours. The whole process involves shaping the clay on a spinning stone wheel using your own hands and traditional tools. Let your creative mind run wild and decorate your jars to your heart's content. After, you will cook the jars inside in-ground kilns to harden them so they can stay in shape. </p><br>
<p> Today, jar-making has become one of the staple activities in Ilocos Sur tour packages. Along with teaching guests how to shape clay, the staff also share interesting stories on the origins of the craft and how they preserve the practice. While they undoubtedly have great cultural significance, these jars are more than just unique souvenirs. In fact, they are still often used to ferment homemade specialty vinegar and artisanal wines made by locals. </p><br>
