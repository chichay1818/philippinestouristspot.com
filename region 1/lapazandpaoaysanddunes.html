<center><h1> La Paz and Paoay Sand Dunes </h1></center>
<p>The sand dunes of La Paz and Paoay, the natural coastal desert shaped by sea and wind, are located along the coast near Laoag City. </p><br>
<p> Its rolling and sometimes steep slopes make it a perfect place for a heart-pumping 4x4 ride and sandboarding. </p><br>
<p> It's one of the top ATV tours in the Philippines. The best time to visit the sand dunes is in the afternoon so that you can avoid the worst of the sun's rays and be able to ride your 4x4 into the sunset.
