<center><h1> Paoay Church </h1></center>
<p> The Paoay Church, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is worth a visit when you go up north. The church, also known as the San Agustin Church, is about 19km southwest of Laoag. Construction of the church began in 1704 and was finished 90 years later. Masses are heard in Ilocano, English, and Tagalog. </p><br>
<p> In addition, Paoay Church's three-story bell tower, which is detached from the main church, played an important part at certain points in Philippine history. </p><br>
<p> It served as an observation post for the Katipuneros against the Spaniards in the 1800s, and then again by Filipino guerillas against the Japanese during World War II. It's a good addition to pigrimage tours in the Philippines.
