<center><h1> Sinking Bell Tower </h1></center>
<p> This 45 meters tall edifice is located in the center of The Laoag city, and was built in 1612 by Augustinian Friars, during the Spanish era.  Some locals told me, when the tower was built a person could enter the tower on a horse back, however now a person of an average height has to lean to enter. However the tower still solves the purpose of its existence as it still rings to summon the Christian faithful for the mass.<p><br>
