<p> Vigan Cathedral, also called the Saint Paul Metropolitan Cathedral, is one of the most iconic Ilocos churches. Standing in front of the city's Plaza Salcedo, this holy building is hard to miss and has been regarded as one of the must-see tourist spots in Vigan. Due to its proximity to the plaza, many travelers also have their photos taken between the two historical sites.  </p>
<p> Juan de Salcedo, a Spanish conquistador, ordered the construction of a temporary church in Vigan back in 1574. At the time, the structure was built with only wood and stalk. The simple building was eventually replaced with a studier one in 1641, the first official Vigan Cathedral. However, the church was damaged by two earthquakes over the years and was ultimately burned in 1739. Following the series of incidents, the fourth and current version of the cathedral was finished in the 1800s under the order of Augustinian priests.   </p>
<p> The whole cathedral boasts a Baroque style, complete with large buttresses on either side. Inside are a silver-paneled altar, 12 minor altars, and brass altar railings. On the other hand, a 25-meter-high bell tower that symbolizes St. Peter sits to the south of the church.  </p>
