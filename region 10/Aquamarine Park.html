<center> <h1 style="front-weight:60px;"> Misamis Occidental Aquamarine Park  </h1></center>

<p>  The coastal region of Misamis Occidental extends over 162 kilometers and features an ecosystem rich with shoals and reefs, essential for the local population's livelihood. This area not only offers scenic beauty but also plays a crucial role in the sustenance of many local communities through its abundant marine resources.However, the region has faced challenges due to unsustainable fishing practices, including the use of dynamite, leading to depleted fish stocks and environmental degradation. This situation has threatened the economic stability of those reliant on fishing for their livelihoods, prompting intervention to preserve both the environment and local economy.
<p>In response, the Misamis Occidental provincial government launched the Misamis Occidental Aquamarine Development and Protection Program (MOADPP) in 2002. The initiative aimed to convert the Misamis Occidental Aquamarine Park into an eco-tourism site, enhancing revenue generation while prioritizing environmental preservation. The program allocated approximately 200 hectares for the development of facilities such as hotels, cottages, a mini zoo, function halls, restaurants, hatcheries, and a mangrove reforestation area. MOAPY Island was established as a haven for rescued dolphins and fish, alongside serving as an area for aquaculture production.</p>
