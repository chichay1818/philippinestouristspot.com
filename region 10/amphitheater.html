<p>The Iligan Anahaw Amphitheater is the largest "open" amphitheater in Mindanao. It has been a venue to numerous events, concerts, festivals and other functions. Iligan's Kasadya Street Dancing Showdown is just one of the biggest events being embraced in the said heritage site.</p>
<p>Anahaw Amphitheater of Iligan City is considered a cultural and historical heritage site by many Iliganons. Located at the southeastern part of the city hall, it is inspired from the ancient Greek model and perhaps is the only one of its kind in Mindanao.<p>
<p>Anahaw Amphitheater is one of the famous attractions in the city that was built in the 1960s using coral stones. The said Amphitheater can hold as many as 5000 people at a single event. Some other times, children were spotted playing in the amphitheater making it the largest playground in Iligan. Attended by all city government workers, the flag-raising ceremony is at the Iligan Anahaw Amphitheater.<p>
<p>The said project continues with ongoing works such as the bleachers that the people in Iligan will have a relaxing seat and safe stairways, retaining walls, and perimeter guard railings. Not only that, the addition of pathways and jogging area on the upper portion of the amphitheater is still ongoing. There is also an improved playground for children that is still with ongoing works. This project will not just make the amphitheater more enjoyable and beautiful but also make the people in Iligan comfortable, safe, and proud of its famous attractions.<p>
