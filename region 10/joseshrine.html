<p> The Jose Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape, also known as the Rizal Park and Shrine, is a protected landscape and memorial to the Philippines' national hero located in the city of Dapitan on the island of Mindanao. It preserves the farm site in barrio Talisay where José Rizal was exiled for four years from 1892-1896 after being accused of sedition and plotting the Philippine revolution in Manila by the Spanish colonial authorities.
<p>The protected area was established in 1940 as the Rizal National Park covering an initial area of 10 hectares (25 acres) through Proclamation No. 616 signed by President Manuel Luis Quezon. In 2000, it was enlarged to its present size of 439 hectares (1,080 acres) with a buffer zone of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was declared a protected landscape under the National Integrated Protected Areas System through Proclamation No. 279.
<p>The Jose Rizal Memorial Protected Landscape occupies a hilly peninsula facing the Dapitan Bay in Zamboanga del Norte. It is located in the seaside barangay of Talisay, about a kilometer northwest from the Dapitan city proper.</p>
