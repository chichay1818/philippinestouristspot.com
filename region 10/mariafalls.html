<p>Maria Cristina Falls has always been captivating people with its grandeur and power that one should need to see when visiting Mindanao. Located in Iligan City, Maria Cristina Falls is the source of power supply in most places in Mindanao, providing 70% hydroelectric power generated from the falls itself.There was once a sultan named Datu Talim who gained fame in the whole town of Maguindanao to Sulu because of his daughter's unsurpassed beauty. The maiden's name is Maria Cristina and hidden from the knowledge of many, Datu Talim is not her real father.
<p>Maria Cristina Falls is the pride of Iligan City. It is a twin waterfall. The legend goes that the identical twins, Maria and Cristina were bathing in the Agus River, and Maria was carried by the current. Cristina tried to save her sister, but the current was so strong, that both of them drowned. </p>
