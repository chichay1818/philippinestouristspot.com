<p>Sagpulon Falls is a natural attraction situated at Barangay San Isidro, in the mountainous part of the municipality of Jasaan, Misamis Oriental. With a towering height of almost 150 ft., its beauty is astounding. Adding to its charm are the streams of water gushing from its walls.</p>
<p>Just 31 kilometres east of Cagayan de Oro City is Barangay San Isidro, Jasaan which houses a virgin forest, virtually untouched by man. Carefully nestled in this forest is the magnificent Sagpulon Falls. This falls has roughly a 100 feet waterfall drop, which translates to water powerfully cascading down, creating an icy cold basin below for travellers to enjoy. Unlike other tourist destinations in CDO however, this scenic spot only gets a handful of tourists as it is not as well advertised as the water-rafting activities that CDO is very famous for. The Sagpulon Falls is similar to Camiguin's Katibawasan Falls but it's a bit wider and has plenty of rivulets in its green walls.As this is relatively a newly discovered waterfall, no story or folklore surrounds the Sagpulon Falls. Travellers will have to be satisfied just by gazing at its towering beauty and refreshing waters.
