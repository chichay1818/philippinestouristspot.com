<center> <h1 style="front-weight:60px;"> Tinago Falls </h1></center>

<p> Tinago Falls is a breathtaking natural wonder nestled in the lush landscapes of Iligan City, Lanao Del Norte, in the Philippines. Aptly named "Tinago," which means hidden in the local language, this majestic waterfall is tucked away in a verdant gorge, surrounded by towering cliffs and dense foliage. Accessible via a winding trail through the forest, visitors are rewarded with a mesmerizing sight as they approach the cascading waters of Tinago Falls.</p>
<p> Upon reaching the falls, visitors are greeted by the sight of a majestic curtain of water plunging from a height of around 240 feet into a tranquil pool below. The cool, crystal-clear waters invite travelers to take a refreshing dip, swim, or simply bask in the natural beauty of the surroundings. Adventurous souls can also explore the cavern behind the waterfall, adding an extra element of excitement to their visit.. </p>
