<center> <h1 style="front-weight:60px;"> White Island </h1></center>

<p>White Island is a sandbar known for its incredibly soft, powdery white sand – and also its stunning views of Camiguin Island. According to local legends, Camiguin used to be FULL of white sand beaches. However, when Mt Vulcan erupted in 1871, it covered these beaches with black sand and stones. White Island is said to be the last remnant of Camiguin’s white sand beaches. <p> The best time to go to White Island is the first boat trip at 5 am. This allows you to watch the sunrise, escape the heat of the day, and avoid most of the tourists who start arriving in their numbers at 6-7 am. </p>
<p> Some 70 percent of the island is underwater. It has numerous hot springs, geysers, and fumaroles and is part of the Ring of Fire, a seismically active belt of volcanoes and tectonic plate boundaries that roughly surrounds the Pacific Ocean. A stratovolcano, Whakaari/White Island began forming some 150,000 years ago. </p>
