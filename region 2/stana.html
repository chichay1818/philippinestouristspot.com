<p> Palaui Island Lighthouse is a historic beacon located on Palaui Island, off the northeastern coast of Luzon Island in the Philippines, specifically in the province of Cagayan. The lighthouse stands proudly atop a rugged cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the Philippine Sea, guiding ships and boats navigating through the treacherous waters of the Babuyan Channel. Built during the Spanish colonial period in 1892, the Palaui Island Lighthouse served as an important maritime landmark, aiding vessels in their journeys and ensuring safe passage along the northern coast of Luzon.</p>
The lighthouse structure itself is a picturesque sight, characterized by its cylindrical tower made of white-painted masonry and its classic design reminiscent of Spanish colonial architecture. Perched atop a rocky promontory, the lighthouse offers panoramic views of the surrounding seascape, with the rugged coastline and lush greenery adding to its natural beauty. Visitors to Palaui Island can marvel at the lighthouse's historical significance while soaking in the breathtaking scenery that surrounds it.
