<p>Tumauini Church, officially known as the San Matias Parish Church, is a stunning Baroque-style church located in the town of Tumauini, Isabela, Philippines, although it is often associated with Cagayan Province due to its proximity. Constructed in the 18th century by the Dominican friars, Tumauini Church is renowned for its unique cylindrical bell tower, which stands as a prominent landmark in the region. The church's architectural design is a fusion of Spanish colonial and native Filipino influences, characterized by its massive stone walls, intricately carved wooden doors, and ornate decorations.</p>
<p> One of the most remarkable features of Tumauini Church is its exquisitely designed bell tower, which rises to a height of approximately 50 meters. Unlike traditional bell towers, which are typically square or rectangular in shape, the bell tower of Tumauini Church is cylindrical, with four levels adorned with intricate carvings and geometric patterns. Visitors to the church can climb the narrow staircase inside the tower to reach the top, where they can enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>Inside the church, visitors are greeted by a grand interior adorned with elaborately decorated altars, religious statues, and intricately painted ceilings. The main altar is dedicated to San Matias, the patron saint of the parish, and is flanked by smaller altars dedicated to various saints and religious figures. Throughout the interior, visitors can admire the Baroque-inspired architecture and decorative elements that reflect the church's rich history and cultural significance. Tumauini Church stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of Spanish colonial architecture in the Philippines and remains a cherished landmark in the region.</p>
