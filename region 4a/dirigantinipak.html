<center> <h1 style="front-weight:60px;"> Mount Daraitan and Tinipak River </h1></center>

<p>From the summit of Mt. Daraitan, there is but one last wonder to explore: the majestic Tinipak River, characterised by crystal-clear waters, amazing smooth rock formations, and colourful stones by its banks. Not to mention, cool mini-waterfalls and short underground cave lakes are the best for spelunking. 
Mount Daraitan, located in Rizal near the border of Quezon province, is a natural playground to which both seasoned and budding adventurers can't help but return. The mountain which features forest trails, caves, and rolling grasslands, is ideal for a variety of outdoor activities, including hiking, spelunking, and camping.
Daraitan (739+): A gem at the heart of the great Sierra Madre mountain range, close enough to Manila to do as a dayhike, is Mt. Daraitan, which sits near the border of Tanay, Rizal, and General Nakar, Quezon.</p>
