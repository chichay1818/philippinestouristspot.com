Its structure is made of hardwood, bricks, and sliding windows with capiz shells. It is one of the must-visit historical tourist spots in the Philippines.The wealth of Rizal’s family can be traced back to their principalian roots, a Filipino class rewarded with either a gobernadorcillo or cabeza de baranggay position.
