<center><h1>COBRADOR ISLAND</h1></center>
<p>Cobrador Island is located in the municipality of Romblon in the province of Romblon, Philippines. 
It is situated to the west of Tablas Island, north of Sibuyan Island, and south of Banton Island. The island has an area of approximately 8 square kilometers. </p><br>
<p>Among beachgoers, Romblon is best-known for their three-island tour, which covers the isles north of Rombon Island: Alad, Logbon, and Cobrador.
 Of the three, Cobrador Island is the farthest and the northernmost, but it is also inhabited. Most of the settlements, however, are in the western and 
 southwestern coasts, which are covered in a a wide bed of fine grains, shells and coral bits. The interior of the island is generally hilly, with some 
 rocky cliffs and formations protruding into the sea, framing the serene beachscapes.</p><br>
<p>Cobrador Island was first settled by the Spanish in the early 1600s. It was originally used as a base for trading and piracy operations in the area. In 1637, 
the Spanish established a permanent settlement on the island and began to cultivate crops and livestock. The island remained under Spanish control until 1898 when it was ceded
 to the United States following the Spanish-American War.</p><br>
