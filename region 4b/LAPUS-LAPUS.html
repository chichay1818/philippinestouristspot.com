<p> Lapus-Lapus Beach - a secluded white-sand beach with a jungle back-drop, hidden amongst the coves dotting the limestone cliffs of Calatrava.  The name Lapus-Lapus itself refers to the passages between the rock outcroppings dividing the beach.  Half the excitement of this locale is the journey to get there – the beach is only accessible by bangka from the main town and you’ll pass both jungle covered mountains and remote fishing villages before you arrive. </p>
