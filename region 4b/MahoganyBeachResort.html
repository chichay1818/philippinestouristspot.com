<p> Las Cabanas Beach is located around 5km from 
El Nido main town.The best option is to grab a tricycle 
from El Nido town centre which will take around 15 minutes.
We paid 150 pesos between three people for a one way trip 
($1 USD per person). Las Cabanas Beach in El Nido is most 
commonly known for its incredible sunsets, and is a must 
visit location when travelling to El Nido.
