<p>Marinduque is a heart-shaped island which lies between the Bondoc Peninsula at the south- eastern part of Luzon and the island of Mindoro.
  It is bounded by four bodies of water, on the north by Tayabas Bay, northeast by Mongpong Pass, South-east by Tayabas Strait, and Sibuyan at the south.
  The first inhabitants of Marinduque were Malay natives. They established trade relation with the Chinese as early as the Sung Dynasty as evidenced by 
  the artifacts and shards still found in caves that abound on the island.
  Marinduque is thought to have been under the administrative influence – if not controlled-of the Bonbon (Batangas) settlement founded by Datus Dumangsil and Balkasusa,
   members of the ten- datu expedition from Borneo.</p><br>
<center><h1>Boac Cathedral</h1></center>
<p>The church was built in 1792 through the combined efforts of the Jesuits and the faithful. 
Because Boac was prone to pirate raids during those days, the Jesuits designed the church to serve as both a 
house of worship and a fortress surrounded by thick walls. The fortress walls, terra cotta bricks of the main church, 
and the cut adobe blocks of the bell tower remain strong to this day, held together by a mortar fortified with tisa (chalk),
 goso (seaweed), and apog (lime).</p><br>
<p>Our Lady of the Immaculate is the cathedral’s titular patroness as well as the patroness of the town.
 Boac’s Marian devotion
 is strongly rooted in the belief that the Blessed Mother keeps a watchful eye on the town, the church is also 
 dedicated to another of Mary’s epithets: 
 the Birhen ng Biglang Awa (Our Lady of Prompt Succor).According to local lore, during a particularly savage pirate attack,
  Boakeños sought shelter within the church’s walls and prayed for the intercession of the Blessed Mother. She did not fail them, suddenly 
  appearing before the invaders with her arms outstretched. The apparition so frightened the pirates that they left screaming. </p><br>
<p>This event led to the devotion to the Mahal na Birhen ng Biglang Awa who, through her boundless mercy, continues to provide Boakeños with both 
spiritual and physical refuge in their time 
of greatest need.In 1958, the venerated image of Mahal na Birhen ng Biglang Awa was canonically crowned. She is also the patroness of Marinduque.
The feast day of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception is celebrated on December 8. This is preceded by  the daily Misa Novenario (Novena Mass) 
from November 29th to December 6th and a Mass and cavalcade on 7th.</p>
