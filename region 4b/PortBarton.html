<center><h1> Port Barton </h1></center>

<p> Port Barton is just a small village along the western coast of 
northern Palawan. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a town. 
It is simply one of the barangays of the municipality of San Vicente. The confusion probably stems from the fact that when locals say 
"San Vicente," they usually refer to the town proper (near Long Beach).</p><br>
