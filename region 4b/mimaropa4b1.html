<center><h1> Ambulong Island </h1></center>
<p> Ambulong Island is one of the lesser-known gems in the Philippines, offering pristine natural beauty and a tranquil escape from the 
hustle and bustle of more crowded tourist destinations. It is located in the province of Occidental Mindoro, part of the MIMAROPA region. 
Ambulong Island is situated off the southern coast of Mindoro Island, closely associated with the municipality of San Jose. It is surrounded 
by the clear, blue waters of the Sulu Sea. The island boasts of rich marine biodiversity, pristine beaches, and a relatively untouched natural
 environment, making it an ideal spot for eco-tourism and adventure activities. Travel time and availability of transportation may vary 
depending on weather conditions and local arrangements.</p><br>
<p> Ambulong Island is a perfect destination for those looking to explore the natural beauty of the Philippines away from the more commercialized 
tourist spots. Its unspoiled beaches, vibrant marine life, and opportunities for relaxation and adventure make it a must-visit for eco-tourists 
and nature lovers. As always, visitors should strive to leave a minimal environmental footprint to preserve the beauty and integrity of the island 
for future generations.</p><br>
<p> The best time to visit Ambulong Island, like much of the Philippines, is during the dry season from November to May. This period generally 
offers the best weather conditions for beach activities, diving, and snorkeling, with less risk of rain and typhoons. The months of March, April, 
and May are particularly popular due to the warm summer weather, though these months can also be quite busy in other tourist destinations.</p><br>
