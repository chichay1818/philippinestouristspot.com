<center><h1> Mount Iglit-Baco National Park </h1></center>
<p> Mount Iglit-Baco National Park is a significant conservation area located in the heart of Occidental Mindoro, Philippines.
 It was established to protect the habitat of the critically endangered Tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), a small, buffalo-like
 animal endemic to Mindoro Island.The park is also home to indigenous communities, including the Mangyan people, who have 
a rich cultural heritage and traditional practices. Visits can provide insight into their sustainable way of life and their
 relationship with the natural environment.</p><br>
<p>The primary goal of the park is the conservation of the Tamaraw. Once close to extinction, the efforts have helped stabilize 
its population, though it remains critically endangered. The park provides a unique opportunity to potentially see these creatures 
in their natural habitat, especially during the summer months when they are more likely to come down to the lower grasslands.</p><br>
<p> Mount Iglit-Baco National Park is characterized by its diverse ecosystems, including grasslands, tropical lowland forests, and 
montane forests, which are home to a variety of endemic and native flora and fauna. It's a haven for biologists and nature lovers alike.T
he best time to visit Mount Iglit-Baco National Park is during the dry season, from late November to early May. This period offers the most
accessible trekking conditions and the highest likelihood of spotting the Tamaraw, as they descend to lower elevations to graze.</p><br>
