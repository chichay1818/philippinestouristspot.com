<p> Mimaropa (officially stylized in all caps), officially the Southwestern Tagalog Region[3][4] (Filipino: Rehiyong Timog-Kanlurang Tagalog), is an administrative region in the Philippines. It is one of two regions in the country having no land border with another region (the other being Eastern Visayas). The name is an acronym combination of its constituent provinces: Mindoro (divided into Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro), Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan.The province boasts a diverse array of attractions, from pristine beaches and lush mountains to cascading waterfalls and thriving marine ecosystems. Tourists are drawn to its picturesque destinations such as Puerto Galera, renowned for its vibrant underwater world and lively beach scene, and Mount Halcon, the highest peak in Mindoro offering challenging treks and breathtaking vistas.</p><br>
<p> The region was part of the now-defunct Southern Tagalog region until May 17, 2002.[5] On May 23, 2005, Palawan and the highly urbanized city of Puerto Princesa were moved to the region of Western Visayas by Executive Order No. 429.[6] However, on August 19, 2005, President Arroyo issued Administrative Order No. 129 to put in abeyance Executive Order No. 429 pending a review.[7] On July 17, 2016, Republic Act No. 10879 formally established the Southwestern Tagalog Region to be known as Mimaropa, discontinuing the Region IV-B designation; however, no boundary changes were involved.[3]</p><br>
<p> Calapan is Mimaropa's regional center.[8] However, most regional government offices such as the Department of Public Works and Highways[9] and the Department of Budget and Management are in Quezon City, Metro Manila.Economically, Oriental Mindoro is primarily agrarian, with agriculture and fishing being major industries. The province is known for its abundant harvests of rice, coconut, and various fruits, contributing significantly to the country's agricultural output. Additionally, tourism plays a crucial role in the local economy, providing employment opportunities and boosting local businesses.</p><br>

<p>While technically not on Lubang Island itself, Cabra Island is located nearby and is accessible by boat. It's known for its beautiful beaches and coral reefs, making it a popular destination for day trips and island hopping.</p><br>
<p>Barangay Bayanan is primarily known as a jump-off point for treks up Mount Halcon, the highest peak in Oriental Mindoro. As such, it is not typically a tourist destination with hotels or attractions. However, visitors to Barangay Bayanan can enjoy the natural beauty of the surrounding area and may find basic accommodations available for those planning to climb Mount Halcon.</p><br>
