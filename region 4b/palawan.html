<center><h1>EL NIDO</h1></center>
<p>El Nido is a municipality on the northernmost tip of the province of Palawan, characterized by awe-inspiring natural beauty, from dazzling lagoons, white sand beaches,
 rocky islets, and towering limestone cliffs to glasslike waters teeming with abundant marine life.
  No wonder El Nido has earned nothing but praise from visitors and numerous accolades for being one the best island and
   beach destinations in the world.</p><br>
<p>El Nido encompasses over 40 islands peppered across the Bacuit Archipelago, each with its own unique geological wonders but the same natural majesty.
 Its surrounding waters are a stunning mix of blue-green colors, its palm-fringed beach pockets have powdery sands, and its marine-protected areas offer some of the best diving experiences in the entire Philippines. 
Despite being a first-class municipality, the town still has a sleepy and laid-back atmosphere.
 But El Nido has also seen a rise of numerous establishments over the years, accommodating record-high tourist arrivals in the area of about 150,000 in a year. Accommodations 
 here range from budget-friendly hostels and homestays and mid-range beachfront hotels to luxurious and exclusive resorts. </p><br>
<p>El Nido, also known as Bacuit, has been inhabited by humans since at least 2680 BC, possibly as early as 22,000 years ago.[7] This was confirmed by fossils and burial sites dating back to the
 Late Neolithic Age that can be found in many caves and excavation sites surrounding the municipality, particularly in Dewil Valley's Ille Cave in New Ibajay. Chinese traders regularly visited the area of Palawan for its edible birds' 
 nests during the Song dynasty (960–1279).</p><br>
