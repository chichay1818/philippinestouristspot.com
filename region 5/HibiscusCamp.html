<center><h1>Hibiscus Camp </h1></center>

<p>Mt. Isarog is an active volcano and is 2011 meters high. Imagine the height where Hibiscus Camp is located. Going up, we saw the breathtaking view of the valley and the mountains surrounding the volcano.<p><br>
<p> As we entered Hibiscus Camp, we saw a mini restaurant for those who want to try Kinalas. It also houses an A-frame mini house and a garden full of plants so if you are a Plantito or Plantita you'll surely enjoy this place. On top of the house is a view deck that you'll want to hang out for the whole day because of the unobstructed and breathtaking view of Bicol.<p><br>
<p> Hibiscus Camp, a garden resort located in the mountain village of Consocep in Tigaon, Camarines Sur. Perched on the slopes of Mount Isarog, the camp boasts a stunning view of Lake Buhi, Lagonoy Gulf, Mount Asog and if the sky is clear, even Mount Mayon. It was definitely one of the most beautiful places I've been in the Bicol Region.</p><br>
