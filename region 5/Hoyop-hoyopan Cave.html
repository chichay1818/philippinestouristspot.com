<center><h1> Hoyop-hoyopan Cave </h1></center>

<p>Hoyop-hoyopan cave is located in a remote area in Camalig. Far from the bustling cities and towns of Albay. With its location, it is a good hiding spot. According to our guide, the cave served as a place of refuge in times of crisis. During World War 2, it became a place of refuge for Filipino soldiers/guerilla fighters. With the wounded and civilians, they hid there while the Japanese attacked and bombarded the areas a few kilometers away from the cave, not knowingly that the Filipinos are just hiding behind them.  During the Martial Law Era, when there were curfews, the cave served as a party place which is why a concrete dance floor can be seen inside.<p><br>
<p>At the entrance of the cave, personnel and a guide greeted us and asked us to pay the fees. They didn't offer helmets and lights but they told us lights from our phones are sufficient for our journey inside. Hoyop-hoyopan means "blow-blow" which is referred to the cool winds that blow through the cave. The cave features a lot of Stalactites and stalagmites that come in different forms. With your imagination, you can see images of the Virgin Mary, a Chicken Joy, and a hand. In the middle, a staircase will surprise you leading to the huge hall of the cave where bats rest during the day. As we go deeper, the pathway became narrower, and we need to squeeze our way. Some parts of the cave were already altered to cater to tourists for easy access but nonetheless, it still gives a natural and mysterious vibes.<p><br>
<pWe were also told that the cave served as a burial site, they found burial jars with bones dating back to ancient times. They also discovered that the cave is subterranean thousands of years ago, as there are fossilized coral reefs found there. ></p><br>
