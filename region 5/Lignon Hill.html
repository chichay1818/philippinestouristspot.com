<center><h1> Lignon Hill </h1></center>

<p>Lig√±on Hill is a prominent hill in the city of Legazpi, some 3 kilometers west of its downtown port area in Albay, Philippines. The summit rises to about 512 feet (156 meters), affording excellent views of the Mayon Volcano to the northwest and the entire city and Albay Gulf to the east.The whole site is managed by the city and provincial government, and has been designated as a nature park.<p><br>
<p>The hill is a prehistoric cinder cone near the foot of Mayon, some 12 kilometers south-southeast of the volcano's summit. It is mainly composed of dolerite and basaltic volcanic rocks.Except for Mayon Volcano, it is the highest point in the city situated next to the Legazpi Airport in barangay 41 (Bogtong) near the city's border with the municipality of Daraga. It hosts the Mayon Volcano Observatory, the central monitoring station of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology built in 1989.<p><br>
<p>In 2006, the park underwent a major renovation with the hilltop leased for private development under a memorandum of agreement with the Albay provincial government.
