<center><h1>Carbin Reef </h1></center>
<p> The Carbin Reef is a spotless white sandbar that sits off the shore of Sagay town in the Negros Occidental province. It is also part of the Sagay Marine Reserve, a 32,000-hectare protected seascape </p>
<p> Aside from its beautiful white sand, the reef's surrounding waters are teeming with wildlife so make sure to bring some snorkeling gear during your visit here. Underneath the waves, you will find a vibrant aquatic ecosystem filled with colorful schools of fish and other marine animals. </p>
<p> The best time to go to Carbin Reef is during the dry season in the Philippines, which typically starts in late December and lasts until the last weeks of May.</p>
<p> Since there are fewer chances of rainfall and tropical storms during these months, it is the perfect time to go snorkeling and sunbathing here. </p>
