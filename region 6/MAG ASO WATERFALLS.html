<center><h1> Mag Aso Water Falls </h1></center>
<p> Nestled in the forest of Barangay Can-omay are hidden waterfalls called Mag-Aso Falls. They were named after "aso" or smoke due to the drizzles resembling smoke that is formed from the strong drop of water. Out of 20 or so waterfalls in Bohol, this cascade is the most accessible from the capital Tagbilaran City. </p>
<center><h1> Mag Aso Water Falls </h1></center>
<p> It was previously damaged during an earthquake that struck Bohol in October 2013. In addition to the quake, erosion and rock shifting also affected the falls' overall features and their height. Nevertheless, its beauty remains as 8-meter twin waterfalls with a turquoise river at the bottom. </p>
<p> Since the falls are located in an untouched forest, there are no establishments within its vicinity, so guests are also advised to bring food or whatever they need for the trip.Â 

<p> Mag-Aso Falls sits about 17 KM away from Tagbilaran City and can be reached via a car ride. As for public transport, travelers can take a jeep at Cogon Market that will head to Antequera. From there, you can transfer to a rentable motorcycle (habal-habal) or tricycle that will take guests directly to Mag-Aso Falls.
