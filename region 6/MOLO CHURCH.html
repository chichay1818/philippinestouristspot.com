<p> Molo Church, formally known as St. Anne Parish Church, is an iconic religious landmark located in Molo District, Iloilo City, Philippines. It is renowned for its captivating Gothic-inspired architecture, characterized by its pointed arches, flying buttresses, and intricate details.</p><br>
<p> The church's facade features a stunning rose window and twin bell towers, adding to its grandeur and charm. Inside, visitors are greeted by a breathtaking interior adorned with magnificent stained glass windows, intricately carved wooden altars, and elegant chandeliers.  </p><br>
<p> However, what truly sets Molo Church apart is its unique collection of 16 statues depicting female saints, which line both sides of the church. These statues, each delicately crafted and meticulously displayed, have earned Molo Church the nickname "the feminist church" or "the feminist cathedral." Beyond its architectural and artistic beauty, Molo Church holds great historical and cultural significance.
