<center><h1> Manuel Roxas Ancestral House</h1></center><br>
<p> The birth place of the 1st president of the Republic - it ought to tell a lot of story. But aside from the original house posts/foundation and capiz in the windows, there is nothing about the life that Roxas has despite spending years before high school here.
</p>
<p> There are antiques indeed but not of Roxas time. Many add-ons made during the years as ownership transfer from one descendant to another. It could be a cool coffee / hangout place though should the owner decides to reimage the place. </p>
<p> preserved ancestral houses in the country.
Large windows made of Woods and the Famous Capiz Shells will welcome you.
<p> You can walk to reach the abode from the city proper. There is a entrance fee for those who want to explore the historic house.

<h1> Roxas President's Inn </h1>

<p> The Roxas President's Inn always thinks Your Comfort First, Just Like Home. The warmth, the genuine country touch and personalized attention are second nature to the hotel. A feeling of home away from home.
<p> The inn sits majestically accessible at the heart of Roxas City's Plaza. It takes its name from the first Republic's President Manuel Roxas, who was born just a block away.
<p> The Spanish-Filipino influence in its architecture exudes aura of artistic elegance and nostalgic charm. With a blend of the Filipino's past and present lifestyle, the Roxas President's Inn is in a class of its own.
