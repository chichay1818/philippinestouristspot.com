<center><h1> Napti Island </h1></center>
<p> For those bold enough to attempt swimming to this island from Baybay beach, kudos to them. It is quite a challenge. Just make sure that no sharks are around when you do this. </p>
<p> About three to four hectares big located at the Sibuyan Sea, fronting Brgy. Agojo, Panay, this inhabited island has white colored beach that is actually due to accumulated skeletal coral remains. </p>
<p> Plenty of live coral reefs are abundant near its shore.  Fishing enthusiasts and gourmets alike have wonderful time here for the plentiful fish and lobsters. 
<p> There is also a small cave, about 100 meters long and winds several feet below the surface across the island commands a breathtaking view of Roxas City and Panay.

<p> Just a short drive away from Moalboal and Panagsama, it offers a quiet, idyllic setting for your holiday. The location couldn't get any better for diving as one of the best reefs in the area is directly in front of your ocean view room. The reef is perfect for beginner divers, and also for snorkelers. However the step walls make an exhilarating dive for seasoned advanced divers.
<p> The resort's architecture is a blend of Mediterranean and native styles incorporating local stone and thatched roof with white arches and Spanish tiles. Each room has either a large arched doorway or huge glass sliding doors to provide guests with amazing ocean views.
