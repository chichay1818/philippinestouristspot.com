<center><h1> Nipas Wind Farm </h1></center>
<p> While walking along Boracay's beachfront, one might take a glimpse of an array of wind turbines situated on the foothills of Nabas' mountain ranges. </p><br>
<p> These are courtesy of Nabas Wind Farm which delivered its first power to the Visayas Grid in 2015. The construction was led by PetroGreen Energy Corporation (PGEC), a fully owned subsidiary of PetroEnergy Resources Corporation (PERC).  </p><br>
<p> Barangay Pawa, a remote area in Nabas, is sited high up in its mountain ranges. It is said that this barangay is where winds blow the strongest among all other areas in Nabas.
