<p>Casaroro Falls is an incredible single-drop waterfall in the mountain region of Valencia. Just a 20-minute drive from the town of Dumaguete on Negros Island, this gem is one of many amazing waterfalls in the region. To reach the falls, there is a short hike down a few hundred stairs before a short river trek.In the town of Valencia, Negros Oriental located 9.4 kilometers west of Dumaguete City lies the beautiful Casaroro Falls considered to be the most photographed waterfall in the entire Negros province.</p>
<p>Casaroro Falls is lodged deep into the rock crevices of the rugged Valencia mountains. With an astounding height of 100 feet, the water plunges into a deep cold basin before it flows down to a stream. The waterfall is considerably narrow, instead of the usual wide cascade, but this is precisely what makes Casaroro unique. Though despite its narrowness, the volume of water that drops is heavy and causes a roar as it touches the pool. Around the basin are natural boulders huge enough to rest any traveler's weary feet.</p>
