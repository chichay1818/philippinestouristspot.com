<center> <h1 style="front-weight:60px;">  Chocolate Hills Natural Monument </h1></cente>

<p>Hundreds of domed limestone hills, covered in grass that turns brown in the dry season.The Chocolate Hills Natural Monument is a geological wonder located in the province of Bohol, Philippines.It consists of at least 1,260 conical hills, with some estimates as high as 1,776, spread over an area of 50 square kilometers in the municipalities of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan.The hills are composed of marine limestone that accumulated in a shallow sea during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene era, about two million years ago.The area was eventually lifted from the sea, and erosion and dissolution of the limestones by acid rain carved the limestone formations into their current cone shape.Each mound varies from 30 to 50 meters in height, with the highest reaching up to 120 meters</p>
<p>The Chocolate Hills were designated as the Philippines' third National Geological Monument in 1988.In 1997, Proclamation No. 1037 was issued by then-President Fidel V. Ramos to protect and maintain the natural beauty of the Chocolate Hills and prevent inappropriate exploitation of the area.The designated area, known as the Chocolate Hills Natural Monument, covers a total of 1,776 hills located in the municipalities of Carmen, Batuan, Sagbayan, Bilar, Valencia, and Sierra Bullones.The Chocolate Hills are a major tourist attraction in Bohol, with over 1 million visitors in 2023.During the dry season, the grass covering the hills dries up and turns brown, giving the hills their distinctive "chocolate" appearance.However, balancing protection, resource utilization and tourism are challenges faced by the Chocolate Hills
