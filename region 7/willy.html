<p> Willy’s Rock is arguably Boracay’s most photographed landmark. It’s a rocky outcrop that forms a tidal island with a statue of the Virgin Mary on top of steps that are carved into the volcanic rock. Willy’s Rock gets its name from the nearby Willy’s Beach Club Hotel and is situated near Station 1 on Boracay’s 4 km stretch of white sandy beach.</p>
Embark on an unforgettable journey as you set out to visit the captivating Manjuyod Sandbar, a hidden gem nestled near Dumaguete City. As the sun rises over the tranquil North Bais Bay, the sandbar emerges like a pristine oasis, earning its reputation as the "Maldives of the Philippines." This enchanting paradise, known for its vast stretches of powdery white sand, beckons you to a world of wonder and relaxation. As low tide unveils the sandbar's splendor, embark on an idyllic dolphin-watching experience, witnessing these playful creatures in their natural habitat. With the gentle waves lapping against the shore, you can indulge in thrilling banana boat rides or simply bask in the sun's warmth on the sandbar's serene expanse. </p>
