<center><h1>Tarangban Falls</h1></center>
<p> The beauty of Tarangban Falls lies in its cascading effects which stretch sideways. It’s the highest waterfall 
in Calbayog City and people have been admiring it for many years due to its serene location and magnetic appearance. It’s a 
huge waterfall and instead of being upright like many waterfalls are, you’ll notice that the rock formations where the water flows 
through are slanting so it adds character to it.</p><br>
<p> Tarangban Falls is located in Barangay Tinaplacan in Calbayog City, Samar, Philippines. A trip to the falls if 
you’re staying at the town proper will take a couple of rides and trekking. You need to leave your hotel around 7:00 am 
to start your trip early. You must then ride a jeep or van which goes directly to Barangay Tinaplacan then register at the 
entrance and hire a tourist guide for a fee.</p><br>
<p> You’ll go again on another journey from the highway to Bangon Falls then from Bangon Falls another 30 to 40 
minutes of trekking to finally reach this wonderful destination. Don’t worry because it’s such a stunning place that 
you won’t mind all that travel just to get to the falls.</p><br>

 <p> The Meaco Hotel in Calbayog offers comfortable and modern accommodations, conveniently located for both business
  and leisure travelers. With well-appointed rooms, friendly service, and amenities such as free Wi-Fi and complimentary breakfast, 
  it's a great choice for visitors to Calbayog.</p><br>
  
  <p> Calbayog has very limited places to stay, so after finding no room in the other 2 bigger hotels, we decided to stay in Meaco Hotel, right in the center of downtown.
Tricycles ply this main road so it's accessible and easy to go to the mall.
The rooms in Meaco are bigger than we were used to at the other hotels but the bathroom can get flooded so wear the slippers provided. However, be careful when you go out of the bathroom cause the bedroom floor seem to have some coating that becomes slippery when wet.
Since the hotel don't have a restaurant, in the morning we have to call front desk and order breakfast and they bring it up to your room. 
Breakfast was corned beef and sunny side-up egg and 3 in-1 coffee.
Overall, the hotel is clean and efficient. Yes I will recommend it.</p><br>
