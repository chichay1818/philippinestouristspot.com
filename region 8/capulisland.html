        It is located between the main Samar Island and Luzon Island in the heart of the treacherous waters of the San Bernardino Strait facing the Pacific Ocean. It is a historical island dated back 1800 when the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade was still flourishing. <br>
        Capul got its name from the shortened word “Acapulco” on which the island also serves as the last stop of every galleon vessel coming from Manila before it continues its voyage to Acapulco, Mexico <br>
        One interesting part of this destination is that you will be amazed as so much was the dialect that the locals are using. They speak Inabaknon instead of Waray-Waray considering their geographical location. Inabaknon is a family of language of Sama-Badjao which is not part of the Visayan language family.
