<center><h1> Homonhon Island </h1></center>
<p> Homonhon Island is located in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines. It's a small island known for its natural beauty, pristine beaches, 
and rich historical significance. One of the most notable events in Philippine history occurred hereâ€”the first mass held by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521,
 marking the introduction of Christianity to the Philippines.</p><br>
<p>To get to Homonhon Island from Tacloban City, take a van or bus from Abucay Grand Terminal. In Guiuan on the coast of Leyte Island, take a cab to the jetty. 
There is only one boat trip to the island daily dependent on the weather.</p><br>
