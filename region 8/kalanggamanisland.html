        Kalanggaman Island is just one of the Philippines natural riches located in the municipality of Palompon in the province of Leyte. Though the island is geologically positioned in Leyte, it is just one to two hour boat ride from Malapascua Island in Daan Bantayan Cebu. <br>
        There are no restaurants and carinderia, so make sure to buy your food supplies in Palompon Market. There is no source of potable water in the island, so make sure to bring enough drinking water to last until the next day. Also, you will be given a few gallons of water by the tourism office (depending on how many people are in your boat), which you can use for cleaning utensils, bathing etc. <br>
        There is no electricity in the island. They have generators used mainly for lighting at night. Dont forget to bring power banks for your gadgets.
