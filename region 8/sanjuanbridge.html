<center><h1> The San Juanico Bridge </h1></center>
<p> The San Juanico Bridge stretches over the San Juanico Strait, which separates the islands of Samar and Leyte in the Eastern Visayas
 region of the Philippines. Spanning a total length of approximately 2.16 kilometers (1.34 miles), it is the longest bridge in the Philippines 
and is renowned for its elegant design and scenic views.</p><br>
<p> The bridge features a central main span supported by a single steel girder arch, with additional spans supported by concrete piers. 
It provides vital transportation links between the provinces of Samar and Leyte, facilitating the movement of goods, vehicles, and people 
between the two islands. </p><br>
<p> Traveling across the San Juanico Bridge offers breathtaking vistas of the surrounding seascape, with panoramic views of the San Juanico Strait, 
nearby islands, and lush coastal landscapes. The bridge is particularly spectacular during sunrise and sunset, when the changing light casts a magical 
glow over the waters below.</p><br>
