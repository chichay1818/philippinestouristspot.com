<center><h1> Yolanda Monument </h1></center>
<p> Not too long ago, the strongest worldwide record of super typhoon in recent history struck Leyte in 2013, killing 2,200 locals and practically leveled the capital city of Tacloban to the grounds. Its strong winds (velocity of 195 mph) uprooted trees, roofs, and caused storm surges as high as 10-20 feet that smashed into the nearby communities and turned the province into a wasteland. </p><br>
<p> Years later, the newly rebuilt Tacloban city commemorates the lives lost during this natural catastrophe with the Yolanda Memorial Monument, located in Sagkahan district, beside Tacloban Convention Center, also known as Astrodome. 

In the duration of the storm, the Astrodome served as an evacuation center for 8,000 residents, which is why it’s fitting that a Memorial monument is built beside it. Other than the victims’ loved ones, the memorial monument also served as a token of gratitude for the organizations, institutions and individuals who donated and helped in the City’s rebuilding. But because of the outpour of international help, the City managed to restore its former glory in a few years’ time. </p><br>
<p> You’ll go again on another journey from the highway to Bangon Falls then from Bangon Falls another 30 to 40 
minutes of trekking to finally reach this wonderful destination. Don’t worry because it’s such a stunning place that 
you won’t mind all that travel just to get to the falls.</p><br>
