Thousands of devotees which range from children to adults will be usually seen in the place but most of them are teenagers. During Holy Week, especially on Good Friday, Catholics in the whole province of Zamboanga del Norte perform their penitential rites in “Katkat Sakripisyo”. On the way up, there are 14 stops which correspond to the Station of the Cross. 
<p>There’s a novena on Good Friday that starts at 4AM and followed by a mass at the elementary school which is located on top of the peak. When you reach the peak, you will be rewarded by the beautiful scenery of the two cities of Zamboanga del Norte, Dipolog and Dapitan. The air above the ground is so refreshing that dries away your sweat. Taking a break at the peak and having some picnic is also great to do before going down.
