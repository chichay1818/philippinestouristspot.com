<center> <h1 style="front-weight:60px;"> Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception </h1></center>

<p>The first church was originally located at the front of Plaza Pershing, where the present Universidad de Zamboanga stands. The church was designated a cathedral in 1910 when the diocese of Zamboanga was created. In 1943, the cathedral was one of the edifices bombarded by Japanese soldiers during World War II. In 1956, the cathedral was relocated beside Ateneo de Zamboanga University, formerly known as the Jardin de Chino..</p>
<p>The cathedral was solemnly dedicated on December 6, 1999, with Cardinal-Archbishop Ricardo Vidal of Cebu and President Joseph Estrada Ejercito as guests of honor. The day chapel, columbarium, baptistery, the multi-purpose hall and office were constructed in 2002.A more recent addition to the cathedral is the Century Bell Tower, which broke ground on the feast of the Immaculate Conception in 2010. This belfry, located at the Ateneo side of the cathedral, marked the 100th anniversary of the Archdiocese of Zamboanga.</p>
