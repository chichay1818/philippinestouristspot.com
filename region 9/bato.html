<p> Mount Pulong Bato is a monolith located in Zamboanga City at the Zamboanga Peninsula, the western tip of the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. The mountain is situated in the Upper Abong-Abong Park, inBarangay Pasonanca, only a few kilometers away from the city's downtown section.The mountain is near the premises of the famous Abong-Abong Park, where both domestic and foreign catholic devotees pilgrimage annually during Holy Week to observe the holiday and meditate. Pulong Bato became infamous because when the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology(PHIVOLCS) confirmed the mountain is a volcano which is unknown to most people.</p> 
<p>What is unusual about the mountain is, unlike the other mountains surrounding the city, only Mt. Pulong Bato is made from solid rock. The mountain is situated within the Pasonanca Natural Park and is a popular pilgrimage site for Catholic devotees during Holy Week. The name "Pulong Bato" originated in the 1980s when a station of the cross was built next to the mountain, as "pulong" means "meeting" in Tagalog.</p>
