<p> Maria Maria Clara Rafols Lorenzo Lobregat (April 26, 1921–January 2, 2004) was a Filipina politician from Zamboanga City, where she served as its first woman mayor and also a representative to the Philippine Congress. Lobregat or "Caling" was born April 26, 1921 in Zamboanga City, the second of five children of Don Pablo Lorenzo, who was a mayor of Zamboanga City from 1939 until 1940, a representative to the first Philippine Assembly, and a delegate to the Philippine Constitutional Convention, and Luisa Rafols of Cebu City. Lobregat grew up in the cities of Zamboanga, Cebu, and Manila. She spoke Chavacano, Cebuano, English, Tagalog, and her native Spanish.
<p> Throughout her political career, Lobregat lost in only one election – in 1984 for the lone seat at the Batasang Pambansa. Allied with the Marcoses, she lost to Mayor Cesar Climaco who did not assume his post as assemblyman. With Marcos gone and the then opposition-turned-administration splitting into factions, Lobregat easily won as representative of theLone District of Zamboanga City in the 1987 legislative elections and was reelected in 1992 and 1995. She ran and won the mayoralty in 1998, was reelected in 2001 and was set to file her certificate of candidacy for a third term on January 5 this year. </p>
