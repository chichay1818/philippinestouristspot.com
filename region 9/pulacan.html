<p> The park also features a replica of the Subanen Village, where tourists can interact with tribesmen, witness traditional dances, and learn about their culture and crafts, like basket weaving</p>
<p>Pulacan Falls has its own kind of beauty: plain yet scenic, ordinary but distinct. Going from the national highway to the waterfall, you'll pass via a boardwalk enclosed by large trees. It's not very high, about 30-35 feet, but its scenic beauty is breathtaking and enough to fascinate people.An easy walk, fresh air and tall trees, the relaxing sound of cascades, and the picturesque white water extending to its lovely rocks - what a nice recollection of our little stay in Labangan</p>
